# Cplusplus_Investing_Compound_Interest
Competency:
In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:
Design functi onal programs that comply with industry regulations and best practices
Scenario:
Congratulations! You have completed the interview process and have been hired as a junior developer at Chada Tech. Now that you
have successfully completed your new-hire orientati on and have been introduced to the rest of your team, you are ready to jump in
and start working on your first project.
You are asked to collaborate with Airgead Banking, one of Chada Tech’s clients. Airgead Banking is well known in the community.
They oft en sponsor schools and have recently decided to partner with the local high school to develop a program that will teach
students the concepts of fiscal responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than they make) via an interactive
system. The initi al focus for this project will be on investi ng and the power of compound interest. You will develop an applicati on
that allows users to see how their investments will grow over ti me. Airgead Banking has provided you with a list of functi onal
requirements that describe what they need their applicati on to do.
Directions:
1. Review the Airgead Banking App Functi onal Requirements, located in the Supporti ng Materials secti on. Create pseudocode
or a fl owchart to plan your coding project. Outline your code step-by-step so that you can use it as a guide when coding.
This will be submitt ed along with your zipped applicati on.
a. Do not write code yet. You will do that in Step 3. For this step, write your thoughts in English of what the program
should do.
b. Don’t be concerned with syntax, just list statements, each describing a single acti on.
c. List all steps.
d. Use proper naming conventi ons.
e. Keep it simple—use only one statement per line.
2. Develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) applicati on using secure and effi cient C++ code. Make sure that your
applicati on:
a. Meets all specifi cati ons listed in the Airgead Banking App Functi onal Requirements
b. Follows best practi ces described in the Airgead Banking Standards document
c. Includes in-line comments
3. When your soluti on is fi nished, zip your project including all components (CPP, H, and any other fi les used).
4. Upload your zipped project fi le and pseudocode or fl owchart to the project submission area.
